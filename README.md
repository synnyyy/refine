### 🛠️ Installation & Usage

To start using the Refine library, follow these steps:

1) Load the Refine library by using the loadstring function with the provided URL. Place this code at the beginning of your script:
```lua
local Refine = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/synnyyy/refine/main/project.lua", true))()
Refine:Load() -- Loads the Refine module.
```
2) You are now set.


### 🔒 Accessing Roblox Services

To efficiently access Roblox services and ensure security, you can utilize the Refine library's `Services` feature. By doing so, you can easily define and cache the services you need for your script. Here's an example:

```lua
-- Accessing Roblox services using Refine

local ReplicatedStorage = Refine.Services.ReplicatedStorage
local HttpService = Refine.Services.HttpService
local Network = Refine.Services.NetworkService
```
In the above example, we declare and assign the desired Roblox services using the Refine library. By using Refine.Services, you can directly access various services such as `ReplicatedStorage`, `HttpService` and `Network` 

> ⚡ These service objects are cached for efficiency, ensuring better performance in your script.
